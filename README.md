# DataPoem assessment - Interactive comments section

![Design preview for the Interactive comments section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out these interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. 

We provide the data in a local data. Json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application! 

Your users should be able to: 

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size. 

See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. 

Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies. 

Upvote and downvote comments 

Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use local Storage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed 

Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application 

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
